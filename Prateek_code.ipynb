    "text = \"DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION APPROACH A presumptive diagnosis of asthma can usually be made based on a compatible history of recurrent wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or cough related to common bronchoconstrictor precipitants when appropriate components of the differential diagnosis have been considered and/or eliminated. In some cases, a therapeutic trial of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) may be considered. In all but the mildest cases, the diagnosis should be confirmed with pulmonary function testing or demonstration of airway hyperresponsiveness. Unfortunately, the diagnosis may be difficult to confirm after initiation of therapy since airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness may be mitigated with therapy. A trial of tapering medications may be necessary. Studies have shown that more than one-third of patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma do not meet the criteria for the diagnosis. Adjunctive evaluation, as outlined below, should be undertaken to identify precipitating factors and underlying mechanisms that may be amenable to specific therapies (e.g., allergen avoidance). Cases that require more than a daily moderate-dose ICS combined with a longacting β2-agonist (LABA) (together known as ICS/LABA) should undergo more formal evaluation to assess comorbidities that may make asthma difficult to control and a reassessment of any possible confounding diagnoses that may mimic asthma symptoms (see Table 287-3). ■ PRIMARY ASSESSMENT TOOLS FOR ESTABLISHING ADIAGNOSIS History Patients with asthma most commonly complain of episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, mucus production, or cough upon exposure to triggers listed in Table 287-2. Symptoms may be worse on arising in the morning. Some may have nocturnal symptoms alone. However, such patients should be evaluated for postnasal drip or GERD if that is their sole presenting symptom. Patients frequently complain of symptoms with rapid changes of temperature or humidity. Exercise-induced symptoms are common with increased sensitivity to cold air. As compared to cardiac sources of dyspnea, exercise symptoms tend to develop more slowly after initiation of exercise and tend to resolve more slowly unless a β2agonist is administered after the onset of symptoms. A careful exposure history should be obtained for home (e.g., pets, molds, dust, direct or secondhand smoke), work (work environment and exposure to occupational sensitizers), and recreational (e.g., hobbies, recreational inhalants) exposures. Allergen-sensitized patients may complain of symptoms on exposure to known allergens such as animals and may complain of increased symptoms during specific pollen seasons. Up to two-thirds of patients with asthma will be atopic (as opposed to half of the U.S. population), and almost half will have a history of rhinitis, with many complaining of intermittent sinusitis. In patients with adult-onset asthma, a careful occupational history should be obtained and a history of reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or use of new medications, such as beta blockers (including ophthalmic preparations) and ACE inhibitors (due to potential cough), should be elicited. Physical Examination In between acute attacks, physical findings may be normal. Many patients will have evidence of allergic rhinitis with pale nasal mucus membranes. Five percent or more of patients may have nasal polyps, with increased frequency in those with more severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Some patients will have wheezing on expiration (less so on inspiration). During an acute asthma attack, patients present with tachypnea and tachycardia, and use of accessory muscles can be observed. Wheezing, with a prolonged expiratory phase, is common during attacks, but as the severity of airway obstruction progresses, the chest may become “silent” with loss of breath sounds. Pulmonary Function Tests Effective reduction of the airway lumen in asthma produces increased resistance to airflow, which can be detected as a reduction in expiratory airflow during forced expiratory maneuvers. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio are reduced below the lower limit of normal. The flow-volume loop may show a characteristic scalloping (see Chap. 286). These findings may not be present during acute attacks or on therapy (especially after recent use of bronchodilators). Reversibility is defined as a ≥12% increase in the FEV1 and an absolute increase of ≥200 mL at least 15 min after administration of a β2-agonist or after several weeks of corticosteroid therapy. Diurnal peak flow variability of >20% has also been proposed as an indicator of reversible airways disease, but it is less reliable due to difficulties with quality control and variability of home assessments. Lung volumes and diffusing capacity should be normal in uncomplicated asthma. Assessment of Airway Responsiveness In cases where pulmonary function tests are nonconfirmatory and the diagnosis remains in doubt, testing to demonstrate increased reactivity to provocative stimuli in the laboratory can be undertaken. Methacholine, a cholinergic agonist, inhaled in increasing concentrations is most commonly used. A provocative dose producing a 20% drop in FEV1 (PD20) is calculated, with a value ≤400 μg indicative of airway reactivity. Mannitol is used as well, and occasionally, hypertonic saline may be used. Challenge with exercise and/or cold, dry air can be performed, with a positive response recorded if there is a ≥10% drop in FEV1 from baseline. In the case of suspected environmental/occupational exposures, specific allergen challenges may be undertaken in highly specialized labs. ■ ADJUNCTIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS Eosinophil Counts A large proportion of asthma patients not treated with oral or high-dose ICSs will have eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/μL. Eosinophil counts correlate with severity of disease in population studies. Their presence in patients with severe asthma indicates a likelihood that the patient would respond to medications targeted at type 2 inflammation. Extremely elevated levels should prompt consideration of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or primary eosinophilic disorders. IgE, Skin Tests, and Radioallergosorbent Tests Total serum IgE levels are useful in considering whether patients with severe asthma would be eligible for anti-IgE therapy. Levels >1000 IU/mL should prompt consideration of ABPA. Skin tests, or their in vitro counterparts that detect IgE directed at specific antigens (radioallergosorbent test [RAST]), can be useful in confirming atopy and suggesting allergic rhinitis, which can complicate asthma management. Allergy investigations may be useful, when correlated with a history of reactions, in identifying environmental exposures that may be aggravating asthma. Exhaled Nitric Oxide Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in exhaled breath is an approximate indicator of eosinophilic inflammation in the airways. It is easily suppressed by ICSs and, thus, can be used to assess adherence in patients in whom it was initially elevated. Elevated levels (>35–40 ppb) in untreated patients are indicative of eosinophilic inflammation. Levels >20–25 ppb in patients with severe asthma on moderate- to high-dose ICS indicate either poor adherence or persistent type 2 inflammation despite therapy. ■ ADDITIONAL EVALUATION IN SEVERE/POORLY RESPONSIVE ASTHMA In patients with poorly responsive asthma, additional evaluations for comorbidities (see Table 287-3) may be necessary, including sinus radiographic studies (even in those who have no symptoms of sinus disease) and esophageal studies in those who have symptoms of reflux. In patients with nonreversible disease, many obtain a serum α1 antitrypsin level. Additionally, the following evaluations may be of utility in poorly responsive asthma. Chest Radiography Chest CT can be useful to assess for the presence of bronchiectasis and other structural abnormalities that could produce airway obstruction. New image analysis tools are being used in the research setting to assess airway properties such as airway wall thickness, airway diameter, and evidence of air trapping. Sputum Induced sputum may be used in more specialized centers to help characterize type 2 and non–type 2 inflammation by detection of eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. In severe asthma, there is some evidence that some patients may have localized persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation despite lack of peripheral eosinophils on blood analysis. TREATMENT Asthma GOALS OF ASTHMA THERAPY AND ASSESSMENT OF CONTROL Goals of asthma therapy in terms of achieving control of symptoms and reducing risk (as reflected in frequency of asthma exacerbations) are listed in Table 287-4. The therapeutic agents used in treatment are discussed below, and an integrated approach to care is discussed subsequently. A comprehensive treatment approach involves avoiding and reducing asthma triggers and, if necessary, the adjunctive use of medications. Asthma medications are primarily divided into those that relax smooth muscle and produce a fairly rapid relief of acute symptoms and those that target inflammation or mediator production. The former medications are commonly referred to as reliever medications, and the latter are known as controller medications. REDUCING TRIGGERS Mitigation As shown in Tables 287-1 and 287-2, triggers and exposures can cause asthma and make it difficult to control. In the case of those with occupational exposures, removal from the offending environment may sometimes result in complete resolution of symptoms or significant improvement. Secondhand smoke exposure and frequent exposure to combustion products of cannabis are remediable environmental exposures as well. The removal of pets that are clearly associated with symptoms can reduce symptoms. Pest control at home and in the school in those with evidence of IgE-mediated sensitivity (skin test or IgE RAST) may also be beneficial. The effect of dust or mold control in reducing asthma symptoms has been more variable. There is moderate evidence that dust control (impermeable mattress and pillowcase covers) in those patients with symptoms and sensitization may be effective in reducing symptoms only when conducted as part of a comprehensive allergen mitigation strategy. Allergen Immunotherapy Allergen immunotherapy reduces IgEmediated reactions to the allergens administered. It clearly reduces the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and thus may be helpful in reducing this comorbidity. The evidence for its effectiveness in isolated asthma in those who are sensitized and have clinical symptoms is variable. Due to the risk of anaphylaxis, guidelines generally recommend immunotherapy only in patients whose asthma is under control and who have mild to moderate asthma. The evidence base for the effectiveness of sublingual allergen immunotherapy in the treatment of asthma is not substantial. Vaccination Respiratory infections are a major cause of asthma exacerbations. Patients with asthma are strongly advised to receive both types of currently available pneumococcal vaccines and yearly influenza vaccines. COVID-19 vaccination is advised, as well. MEDICATIONS Bronchodilators Bronchodilators relax airway smooth muscle. There are three major classes of bronchodilators, β2-agonists, anticholinergics, and theophylline. β2-Agonists Available in inhaled or oral form, these agents activate β2-receptors present on airway smooth muscle. Such receptors are also present on mast cells, but they contribute little to the efficacy of these agents in asthma. β2-receptors are G protein– coupled receptors that activate adenyl cyclase to produce cyclic AMP, which results in relaxation of smooth muscle. Use β2-Agonists are primarily used in inhaled forms to provide relief of bronchospasm or to reduce the degree of bronchospasm anticipated in response to exercise or other provocative stimuli. Regular use has been associated with tachyphylaxis of the bronchoprotective effect and possible increased airway reactivity. This may be more common in patients with a polymorphism at the 16th amino acid position of the β2-receptor. Frequent short-acting β-2 agonist use has been associated with increased asthma mortality resulting in decreased enthusiasm for use in isolation without inhaled corticosteroids. Short-Acting β2-Agonists Albuterol (also known as salbutamol) is the most commonly used agent. Bronchodilation begins within 3–5 min of inhalation, and effects generally last 4–6 h. It is most commonly administered by metered-dose inhaler. Solutions for nebulization are also used, especially for relief of bronchospasm in children. Oral forms are available but are not commonly used. Long-Acting β2-Agonists Salmeterol and formoterol are the two available LABAs. They have an ∼12-h duration of action. Formoterol has a quick onset comparable to the short-acting β2agonists. Salmeterol has a slower onset of action. These agents can be used for prophylaxis of exercise-induced bronchospasm. In contrast to their use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), these agents are not recommended for use as monotherapy in the treatment of asthma. Their use in asthma is generally restricted to use in combination with an ICS. Ultra-Long-Acting β2-Agonists These agents (indacaterol, olodaterol, and vilanterol) have a 24-h effect. They are only used in combination with ICSs in the treatment of asthma. Safety β2-Agonists are fairly specific for the β2-receptors, but in some patients and especially at higher doses, they can produce tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, and hypertension. They promote potassium reentry into cells, and at high doses, they can produce hypokalemia. Type B (nonhypoxic) lactic acidosis can also occur and is thought to be secondary to increased glycogenolysis and glycolysis and increased lipolysis, leading to a rise in fatty acid levels, which can inhibit conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A. Increased asthma mortality was associated with high-potency β2-agonists in Australia and New Zealand. Increased use of β2agonists for relief of bronchospasm is a clear marker of poor asthma control and has been associated with increased mortality. Questions had been raised as to whether adding LABAs to ICS might be associated with severe adverse asthma outcomes, but several studies have not detected such outcomes in comparison to maintaining the ICS dose. Anticholinergics Cholinergic nerve–induced smooth-muscle constriction plays a role in asthmatic bronchospasm. Anticholinergic medications can produce smooth-muscle relaxation by antagonizing this mechanism of airway narrowing. Agents that have been developed for asthma have been pharmacologically designed to be less systemically absorbed so as to minimize their systemic anticholinergic effects. The long-acting agents in this class are known as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs). Use The short-acting agents in this class can be used alone for acute bronchodilation. They appear to be somewhat less effective than β2-agonists and have a slower onset of action as well. Safety Dry mouth may occur. At higher doses and in the elderly, acute glaucoma and urinary retention have been reported. There was a numerical (but not significant) difference in mortality in African Americans treated with ICS/LAMA versus ICS/LABA for asthma. Theophylline Theophylline, an oral compound that increases cyclic AMP levels by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, is now rarely used for asthma due to its narrow therapeutic window, drug-drug interactions, and reduced bronchodilation as compared to other agents. Controller (Anti-Inflammatory/Antimediator) Therapies Socalled “controller” therapies reduce asthma exacerbations and improve long-term control, decreasing the need for intermittent use of bronchodilator therapies. None of these therapies have yet been shown to prevent progression of airway remodeling or the more rapid decline in lung function that can occur in a subset of asthma patients. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are particularly effective in reducing type 2 inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Corticosteroids bind to a cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor to form a complex that translocates to the nucleus. The complex binds to positive and negative response elements that result in inhibition of T-cell activation; eosinophil function, migration, and proliferation; and proinflammatory cytokine elaboration and activation of nuclear factor-κB. It also attaches to other transcription factors, resulting in deactivation of other proinflammatory pathways.
